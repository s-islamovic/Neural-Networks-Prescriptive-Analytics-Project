Course: Neural Networks and Prescriptive Analytics
Institution: National College of Ireland

Project Overview:

-This project applies neural networks and metaheuristic optimisation techniques to the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
-The goal is to build a predictive model that identifies fraudulent transactions and then improve its performance using a Genetic Algorithm.

The project includes:

-Data preprocessing
-Baseline neural network model
-Genetic Algorithm hyperparameter optimisation
-Model evaluation with ROC curve, AUC, and confusion matrix
